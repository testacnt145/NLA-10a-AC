# Official Release 1.0.0 - 7-Nov-17
[Android Developers Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/11/announcing-architecture-components-10.html)

> Prior to the release of Android Architecture Components we had our own ViewModel implementation. We used Loaders and Dependency Injection to persist our ViewModel through config changes.

> We've also started to use LiveData which hooks directly into the Activity lifecycle. We use it to retrieve and display network data and no longer have to concern ourselves with â€‹network call subscription management.
